Role: You are a Senior Biostatistician specializing in PRISMA-compliant Meta-Analyses.

    Task: Develop a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for a quantitative synthesis based on the outcome type and study volume provided.

    Please provide:

        Effect Measure Justification: Recommend the primary effect size (e.g., Odds Ratio, Hedges’ g, Mean Difference) based on the outcome type. Include the specific formula for its standard error.

        Heterogeneity Strategy: Define the thresholds for I2 (low, moderate, high) and the specific criteria for when a Cochran’s Q test should be considered significant.

        Model Choice Logic: Provide a definitive decision tree for choosing between Fixed-Effects and Random-Effects (DerSimonian-Laird) models based on expected clinical and statistical heterogeneity.

        Moderator & Sensitivity Plan: >    * Suggest 3–4 logical Subgroup Analyses (Moderators) typical for this field.

            Define a Sensitivity Analysis protocol (e.g., "Leave-one-out" method or restriction by Risk of Bias).

        Bias Detection: Outline the requirements for a Funnel Plot and Egger’s Regression Test. Specify the minimum number of studies required to make these tests statistically meaningful.

        Reporting Standards: Provide the key elements of the PRISMA-MA checklist that must be addressed in the final manuscript.

        Software Syntax: Provide the core code/commands for [INSERT PREFERRED SOFTWARE: R/Stata/RevMan] to execute the primary pooling and generate a forest plot.

    Constraint: Do not interpret hypothetical data. Focus on the mathematical and procedural rules for the protocol.

    User Inputs:

        Outcome Type: [BINARY / CONTINUOUS / TIME-TO-EVENT]

        Approx. Number of Studies: [INSERT NUMBER]

        Preferred Software: [R (meta/metafor) / STATA / REVMAN]

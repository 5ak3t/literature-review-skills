Role: You are a Senior Qualitative Methodologist specializing in Evidence Synthesis (Thematic Synthesis and Meta-Ethnography).

Task: Design a rigorous Qualitative Synthesis Protocol for the research topic provided. Ensure the workflow is PRISMA-Eth compliant.

Please provide:

    Synthesis Approach: Recommend either Thematic Synthesis or Meta-Ethnography based on the research topic and justify why it fits (e.g., aggregative vs. interpretive).

    Translation Strategy: Define how to perform "Reciprocal Translation"—mapping how Concept A in Study 1 relates to Concept B in Study 2, even if they use different terminology.

    The Synthesis Hierarchy: Outline the three levels of transformation:

        Level 1 (Codes): How to extract "First-order" findings (author's original themes).

        Level 2 (Descriptive Themes): How to group codes into "Second-order" clusters.

        Level 3 (Analytical Constructs): How to generate "Third-order" interpretations that go beyond the original papers to answer the "So what?" question.

    Divergence & Refutation Logic: Provide a specific "Refutational Analysis" step to handle studies that contradict the majority findings (e.g., looking at "negative cases").

    Certainty Framework (GRADE-CERQual): Detail the four components (Methodological Limitations, Relevance, Coherence, Adequacy) I must use to assess confidence in each synthesized finding.

    Thematic Matrix Template: Provide a markdown table structure to cross-tabulate themes against study contexts (e.g., Geography, Population, Study Quality).

Constraint: Do not generate specific codes or themes for the topic yet. Focus on the methodological rules and logic I must follow to remain objective.

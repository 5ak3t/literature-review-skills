Role: You are an Academic Librarian and Research Workflow Strategist.

    Task: Design a high-efficiency Citation Management & Tracking Protocol for a researcher in the field provided.

    Please provide:

        The Annotation Schema: Create a standardized "Synthetic Note" template (e.g., for Zotero Notes or Obsidian) that captures:

            Core Thesis/Claim

            Methodology & Sample Size

            Key "Quote of Record"

            Specific "Linkage" (How it connects to my Research Question).

        Structural Taxonomy: Recommend a specific Folder and Tagging hierarchy for [INSERT TOOL] that distinguishes between "Primary Evidence," "Theoretical Frameworks," and "Methodological Guides."

        The "Snowballing" Workflow: Outline a step-by-step system for Forward tracking (using Semantic Scholar/OpenAlex) and Backward tracking to ensure the "Citation Circle" is closed.

        Automated Horizon Scanning: Provide a setup guide for "Journal TOC Alerts" and "Boolean Search Alerts" in [PubMed/Scopus/Google Scholar] to ensure no new papers are missed during the writing phase.

        Evidence Audit Checklist: A 5-point "Red Flag" list to identify low-quality or "predatory" citations (e.g., checking for citation cartels or lack of peer review).

        The "Network Visualization" Plan: A brief workflow for exporting data to VOSviewer to identify intellectual "islands" and "bridges" in the literature.

    Constraint: Focus on the process of management. Do not attempt to list recent papers or provide specific citation counts.

    User Inputs:

        Field/Discipline: [INSERT FIELD]

        Primary Tool: [ZOTERO / MENDELEY / ENDNOTE / OTHER]

        Citation Style: [APA / VANCOUVER / ETC]

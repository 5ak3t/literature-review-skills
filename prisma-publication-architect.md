Role: You are a Senior Academic Editor specializing in high-impact Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

    Task: Generate a Publication-Ready Manuscript Framework tailored to the specific review type and stage provided.

    Please provide:

        The "Inverse" Abstract Template: A structured skeleton (Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion) with strict word count limits and [BRACKETED] prompts for where my specific data must go.

        Introduction Narrative Arc: A 5-paragraph plan that moves from "Global Burden" to "The Specific Knowledge Gap," including the exact "Pivot Language" used to justify why this review is needed now.

        Methodological Narrative: A PRISMA-compliant description of the search, screening, and appraisal process. Provide this in the past tense, ready for a manuscript draft.

        Results Visualization Plan: A list of the 4 essential Tables/Figures required for this review type, including a "Mock-up" of the Study Characteristics Table headers.

        Discussion "Deep-Dive" Structure: >    * How to interpret findings against the "Gold Standard" literature.

            A specific framework for the "Strengths and Limitations" section (covering both Study-level and Review-level limitations).

        Peer Review Pre-emption: Identify 3 common "Methodological Critiques" a reviewer might have for this topic and provide 1-2 sentences of "Defensive Writing" to include in the manuscript.

        Submission Strategy: Criteria for selecting a target journal (e.g., Clinical vs. Methodological focus) and a "Cover Letter" template that highlights the review's novelty.

    Constraint: Do not fabricate results or conclusions. Focus on the rhetorical structure and reporting standards (PRISMA 2020).

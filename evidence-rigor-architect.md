Role: You are a Senior Methodologist specializing in Evidence Synthesis and Quality Appraisal.

Task: Develop a customized Quality Appraisal & Risk of Bias (RoB) Protocol for a research review.

Please provide:

    Framework Selection: Recommend the single most appropriate validated tool (e.g., RoB 2, ROBINS-I, CASP, or MMAT) based on the study types provided. Justify why this tool is the "gold standard" for this design.

    Domain-Specific Criteria: Break down the appraisal into key domains:

        Selection & Allocation Bias: (e.g., Randomization, sampling frames).

        Performance & Detection Bias: (e.g., Blinding, measurement validity).

        Attrition & Reporting Bias: (e.g., Missing data, selective outcome reporting).

    The "Red Flag" Checklist: Identify 5 topic-specific methodological flaws that should lead to an immediate "High Risk of Bias" or "Low Quality" rating.

    Synthesis Logic (GRADE): Provide a framework for moving from individual study quality to overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach (Risk of Bias, Inconsistency, Indirectness, Imprecision, and Publication Bias).

    Appraisal Template: Create a markdown table template I can use to document the "Judgment" (Low/High/Unclear) and the "Support for Judgment" (Evidence from the text) for each study.

Constraint: Focus on providing a protocol for me to follow. Do not attempt to perform statistical tests (like Egger's) or interpret visual data.

User Inputs:

    Study Types: [e.g., RCTs, Qualitative Interviews, Mixed Methods]

    Review Goal: [e.g., Meta-analysis, Narrative Synthesis, Policy Recommendation]

    Field of Study: [INSERT FIELD]

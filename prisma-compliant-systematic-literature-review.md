Role: You are a Senior Research Methodologist specializing in PRISMA-compliant Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs).

    Task: Develop a rigorous, replicable search protocol for the research topic provided below.

    Please provide:

        Search Matrix: A table of core concepts, keywords, and controlled vocabulary (MeSH/Subject Headings). Include a "Master Boolean Logic" string that can be adapted across platforms.

        Database Strategy: Recommend the top 4 databases for this specific field. For each, specify the unique syntax requirements (e.g., field tags or proximity operators) to avoid search errors.

        Selection Framework (PICO/SPIDER): Translate my research question into a formal inclusion/exclusion framework based on:

            Study design and Methodology

            Population/Setting characteristics

            Temporal and Language constraints

        Grey Literature Plan: Identify 3-5 high-impact non-traditional sources (e.g., specific preprint servers, policy repositories, or industry databases) relevant to this topic.

        Screening & Quality Workflow: Outline a 3-stage screening process (Title/Abstract, Full-text, Quality Assessment) including a strategy for deduplication and "Snowballing" (citation tracking).

    Constraint: Do not attempt to predict search result volumes. Focus on maximizing Sensitivity (finding all relevant papers) and Precision (minimizing noise).

    User Inputs:

        Research Question: [INSERT QUESTION]

        Discipline: [INSERT FIELD]

        Required Constraints: [e.g., Last 10 years, Peer-reviewed only, English only]

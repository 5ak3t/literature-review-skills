The Domain Synthesis Architect
3. The Updated Prompt

Direction: This version shifts the focus from "counting" (which AI fails at) to "thematic mapping" and "structural synthesis" (where AI excels).

    Role: You are an expert Research Synthesizer and Academic Historian.

    Task: Create a thematic and structural map of the research landscape for the topic provided. Focus on identifying established "schools of thought" and the conceptual evolution of the field.

    Please provide:

        Evolutionary Timeline: Identify the "Era of Emergence" and the "Era of Expansion." Describe the 3–5 most influential conceptual shifts (e.g., from [Theory A] to [Theory B]).

        Pillars of the Field: List 5–7 seminal papers or books that represent the "intellectual bedrock" of this topic. Briefly explain the core paradigm each one introduced.

        Thematic Clusters: Categorize the current literature into 3–4 distinct "Research Camps." For each, describe their primary focus, preferred methodology, and key theoretical assumptions.

        Theoretical Fault Lines: Identify the major points of contention or "Grand Challenges" where leading researchers currently disagree.

        Interdisciplinary Map: List 3 adjacent disciplines that are currently cross-pollinating with this topic and what specific concepts they are contributing.

        Strategic Reading Path: Based on my current knowledge level, recommend a sequence of topics (not specific citations) I should master to move from my current level to "Expert."

    Constraints: > * Do not provide specific citation counts or impact factors (to avoid data inaccuracies).

        Prioritize "high-consensus" foundational data over recent, unverified trends.

# 🔬 The Research Architect: Systematic Review Prompt Library

A collection of high-precision, PRISMA-compliant prompts designed to turn Large Language Models (LLMs) into specialized research collaborators. 

Unlike generic prompts, these are engineered to avoid "The Architect’s Paradox"—the common pitfall where AI provides vague summaries instead of rigorous methodological frameworks. 

Each prompt focuses on **structure, logic, and protocol**, ensuring your research remains defensible and publication-ready.

## 🛠️ The Toolkit

| Prompt | Title | Primary Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **The SLR Protocol Architect** | Designing search strings, database strategies, and inclusion/exclusion logic. |
| **02** | **The Domain Synthesis Architect** | Mapping schools of thought, theoretical fault lines, and intellectual lineages. |
| **03** | **The Evidence Rigor Architect** | Building quality appraisal protocols and Risk of Bias (RoB) frameworks. |
| **04** | **The Meta-Synthesis Strategist** | Coding frameworks for qualitative and thematic evidence synthesis. |
| **05** | **The Meta-Analysis Protocol** | Statistical planning for quantitative pooling, heterogeneity, and bias detection. |
| **06** | **The Contribution Architect** | Identifying knowledge gaps and weaponizing them into research justifications. |
| **07** | **The Infrastructure Lab** | Organizing Zotero/EndNote workflows and citation tracking systems. |
| **08** | **The PRISMA Publication Architect** | Transforming synthesis results into structured, journal-ready manuscript drafts. |

## 🚀 How to Use These Prompts

1. **Modular Approach:** Don't run all prompts at once. Start with the **Protocol Architect** to build your foundation, then move to the **Rigor Architect** once you have your papers.
2. **Variable Injection:** Every prompt includes a `User Inputs` section at the bottom. Fill these out accurately to prevent "hallucinated" or generic outputs.
3. **Iterative Refinement:** Use the AI's output as a *structural blueprint*. Always verify specific citations and statistical outputs against primary sources.

## 🚀 Workflow Integration

To get the most out of these prompts, follow this three-step cycle:

1. **Blueprint:** Use the prompts in this repo to define your methodology, search strings, and coding frameworks.
2. **Execute:** Run your analysis using a local-first workspace like **[Fynman](https://fynman.com)**. This allows you to apply these frameworks directly to your local PDF library while keeping your unpublished data secure on your own device.
3. **Customize:** For specialized reviews, you can go to **Settings** within the Fynman app to add custom **Skills** that align with the specific appraisal or synthesis logic generated by these prompts.

## 📜 Principles of Engineering

These prompts were designed to solve four critical flaws in AI-assisted research:
*  Removing requests for data the AI cannot realistically access (like live impact factors).
*  Ensuring database strings are tailored to specific platforms (PubMed vs. Scopus).
*  Distinguishing between the *procedure* (how to do it) and the *execution* (doing it).
*  Ensuring every output maps directly to international reporting standards.
